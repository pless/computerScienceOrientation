Today's Assignment tries to give a little explore to some of the *many* things that people in computer graphics think about.  We are looking for a blog post like the previous weeks, but want you to look at a collection of these demos, then pick one and write about it.  Your blog should be something like the following.  It does not have to say exactly these things (and probably shouldn't depending on which option you choose!), but to give a scope of what kinds of things you should say:

I explored the following demo [URL]

I chose to explore it because ...
which I personally found interesting because ...

The demo does the following:

Here is a screenshot

The demo give a bunch of controls that overall let me ....

Specific examples include: ...

Here are some overall pictures/gifs I made with this.

Recursive Drawing:
This gives an amazing into to recursive drawing.  It takes a bit to get the hang of it, but might be the most interesting set of all those here!

http://recursivedrawing.com/draw.html
Play with this and make any intersting recursive picture and write a blog post of what you tried, what failed and what worked best.




Google Earth Pro (Free Download): This is an amazing tool that captures incredible high resolution imagery around the world and lets you look at thing.

Play with this and find something interesting — perhaps the house you grew up on, and the historical imagery of that location, or some famous landmark or neighborhood, etc,… or compare the data available around GWU with the data available in other parts of the world.  Write a blog post about what you discovered.




Or, experiment with some live tools:

Fractal generation tool:

Harder Recursive tool:

https://www.kevs3d.co.uk/dev/scratchpad/  Look at the “rectangles” example, and figure out how to change something about it to make an interesting effect!

Write a blog post about one of these tools, why did you pick it instead of other ones (what did you find compelling about it)?  What are some options that these tools allowed you to play with, and what were there effects?  What is the prettiest picture or animated gif that you could make?
