Replacement cipher cryptograms are a fundamental type of cryptographic puzzle where each letter in the original message is systematically substituted with a different letter. This form of encryption maintains the structure and spacing of the original text, making it accessible for manual decryption without the need for specialized tools.




When approaching a replacement cipher cryptogram, one effective strategy is to analyze the frequency of each letter in the encrypted message. In the English language, certain letters such as 'E', 'T', 'A', and 'O' appear more frequently. By identifying the most common letters in the cryptogram, you can make educated guesses about potential substitutions. For instance, if a particular symbol or letter appears repeatedly, it is likely to correspond to one of these high-frequency letters, providing a starting point for further decryption efforts.




Another useful technique involves identifying single-letter words within the cryptogram. In English, the only single-letter words are 'A' and 'I'. Recognizing these can help narrow down possible substitutions and provide anchors for decoding surrounding letters. Additionally, observing common short words, such as 'THE', 'AND', or 'TO', can offer valuable clues. By matching patterns and considering the context in which certain letters appear, students can progressively unlock more of the encrypted message.




Lastly, paying attention to letter pairings and common suffixes or prefixes can aid in solving replacement ciphers. For example, the presence of double letters like 'LL' or 'SS' can indicate specific letter combinations, while common endings such as '-ING' or '-TION' can suggest possible substitutions. By systematically applying these strategies and maintaining a methodical approach, you can effectively decipher replacement cipher cryptograms by hand, enhancing their analytical and problem-solving skills in the process.




Your assignment today is to go to the following site:

https://cryptograms.puzzlebaron.com/play.php

and solve *at least two* crytpograms (you can refresh the webpage to get a new puzzle).


Write a blog post that includes the original cryptogram, your solution, and what strategies you used to figure it out.

You are allowed to help others (and get help), but everyone needs to turn solutions to their own puzzles.
