CSCI 1010 -- Lab Exercise for October 4, 2024

Hello!

In this lab, the goal is to explore modern generative AI tools and explore ways that they can give both correct and incorrect answers in surprising ways.  The goal is to give you familiarity with these tools and some understanding of the ways that they can make mistakes.

The endpoint of the lab is a blog post that you will write to share what you have learned.  This should be posted to your GWU blog.  When you are done, you are to submit your blog post here:

Getting started:

There are many tools that you can use that are “Large Language Models”, or LLMs, which can answer questions and follow directions and sometimes interact with images.  Here are some that I believe are free:

Google Gemini:

OpenAI GPT:

Microsoft copilot:

Assignment:

Pick *anything* you want (the more specific the better!) and create interactions with the AI in ways where the AI is right, and ways where it is wrong.  For example, you could ask it to generate images and find a prompt like: “Make a picture of a classroom full of pandas looking at a chalkboard” where it gives a convincing answer, and a prompt like: ““Make a picture of a classroom full of pandas looking at a chalkboard with correct economics equations on it”, where it is likely to have problems..

You could also give text prompts like: “make a haiku about snow” (which probably works), and (for you to figure out) examples where it gives a *clearly* wrong answer.

Once you have examples– that clearly work and clearly don’t work, explore the “middle ground” where things almost work, and try to figure out what the system is good and not so good at.

I suggest you spend about 20 minutes “just trying stuff”, and then narrow down to a particular topic, and write a blog post.
