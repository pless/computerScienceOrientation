Today’s assignment will give you the chance to explore how routing and IP addresses work. Just like all previous labs, you will write your response as a blog post/page for your blogs.gwu.edu blog. Please make sure to include an introduction talking about the tool and a conclusion discussing what you learned along with any other overarching comments you would like to make. 

Today, you are tasked with exploring the https://dnschecker.org/all-tools.php#ipTool tool and then using it to answer the given prompts

Exploration:

Explore the various tools provided by the website. There are a lot of different tools available a lot of which might not be useful. Try to figure out which tools would be helpful for answering the prompts provided below, and try to familiarize yourself with how the tools work. The tools that would be worth focusing on are the Ping tool, the IP Location Lookup tool, the Traceroute tool, and the Website to IP Lookup tool. Please also explore other tools than these.

Prompts:

After spending some time exploring the site, you should be able to answer the following prompts:

What is your computer's IP address?

The ping tool lets you send a message to an address and get back the IP address and the time it took to get a response in milliseconds. What is the IP address for cs.seas.gwu.edu? What is the IP address for emse.seas.gwu.edu? What about google.com? Why are these similar or different?

How long does it take to send a message to google.com using the ping tool?

How long does it take to send a message to www.tsinghua.edu.cn using the ping tool? What is its IP address?

Next use the IP Location Lookup tool. Where does it think your IP address is located?

Where is google.com located? Do you think you'd get the same result if you lived in California?

Where is www.tsinghua.edu.cn located?

Use the Traceroute tool to find the path of IP addresses that your connection goes through to reach www.tsinghua.edu.cn. Then use the IP location lookup tool to see where some of the intermediate IPs are located. What countries is your message going through?

What is the longest ping delay you can find?  How did you find it?

What IP address can you find that maps closest to your home (or other place of interest like the statue of liberty, the pyramids in Cairo, etc...)?

Pick your favorite tool out of all the tools on the site and describe what it does. Why is it your favorite tool? What might be a real-world application for this tool?

When answering these prompts, please make sure to back up your answers with screenshots from the tool!
