Password Strength Estimator




As you start being a “computer person”, you will get asked many questions that you might not know the answer to, like “is this a good password?”.  Today we are going to explore a little about this question.




Before we start, security is a many facetted problem, and (like securing your house), any one weakness is a problem..  But the password is like the “front door” — the way you are expected to come in, and one that you have control over as a user.  In this exercise you are going to learn about an approach to estimating a passwords strength.  This approach is considered to be a little out of date, but I it gives many of the good ideas.




Usually, I tell you to read all the instructions before you start, but this time I want you do these step by step.




First step:  Start your blog post.




Second step: Write down 5 different passwords.  Be realistic about passwords you might actually use.  Don’t use “aukdshciuh3lbbczlkuyf#W7ir29grg31[bv” if that’s not the kind of password you usually use.  Don’t use a password you really use! (because you are going to post them on your blog post).  Put these into your blog post under the heading “Initial Passwords”




Third step: Sort these 5 passwords by *your best guess* of how easy they would be to guess/crack.




Fourth step: For the easiest and hardest, explain your reasoning about why you thought they were easiest or harders.




Write down your list and reasoning in a section “Initial Assessment”.




Fifth Step: Have someone else in your class rate your passwords from worst (easiest to crack) to best




Write down their order under a section “Peer assessment”.  Thank them for their time (by name, or anonymously, at their choice)




Sixth step: put all five passwords through the demo tool here:
     https://zxcvbn-ts.github.io/zxcvbn/demo/




at the top, in the “userInputs” section, make a comma separated list of words that people might know about you, like:

robert,pless,gwu,washington




then put each of your passwords into the password section.  Report the score ( ? / 4 )




And sort them by the tools assessment of strength.

Write a brief conclusion about what you've learned.
